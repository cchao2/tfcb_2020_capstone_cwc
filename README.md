This capstone project uses the dataset from the Glaucoma diagnosis dataset. The questions that this project aims to adress are:

1. Tidy the data, renaming variables to reflect biological context
2. How does the training dataset compare to the test dataset in terms of diagnosis of glaucoma after training?
3. 

Measured Variables:

Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT): compares 24-2 visual fields into 10 regions (5 inferioir regions as mirror images of 5 corresponding superior regions. Differences between superior and inferior zones are compared with normal controls; reliable visual field defined as abnormal if GHT outside of norma limits and/or the Corrected Pattern 
Pattern standard deviation (PSD): provides information about localized loss; measures irregularity by summing absolute value of difference between the threshold value for each point and the average visual field sensitivity at each point. High PSD indicates nonuniform sensitivity loss. PSD value may appear to improve as glaucoma advances, due to global depression.
